# 💬 ECHO-AI Chat App

ECHO-AI is a full-stack real-time chat application built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and powered by **Google Gemini API**. It supports real-time messaging, image sharing, user authentication, and includes a built-in AI assistant (ECHO-AI) that enables users to chat with an LLM — just like Meta AI in WhatsApp.
